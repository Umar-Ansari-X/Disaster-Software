## How It Works

**Tech used:** Python, PyQt5 & PyQtWebEngine, Folium, Playwright, Google Generative AI, Requests

* **GDACS**‚ÄÇ‚Äì multithreaded fetcher pulls the latest *Global Disaster Alert & Coordination System* events, then normalises them into a JSON list
* **Interactive map**‚ÄÇ‚Äì Folium draws colour-coded polygons / rectangles for each event
* **UI**‚ÄÇ‚Äì PyQt for **Dashboard**, **Map**, **Emergency Contacts** and **AI Support** pages
* **AI Support**‚ÄÇ‚Äì Gemini LLM synthesises evacuation plans, while Playwright scrapes real-time Google News + Threads chatter for extra context

* **Gemini plans** ‚Äì click an alert to get condensed information on any disaster and plans generated to help the responder
